# 🚀 Road to Big Tech: Algorithm & Data Structures

This repository is dedicated to rebuilding my problem-solving skills and computer science fundamentals following my military service. My goal is to master technical interviews and secure a Software Engineering Internship for Summer 2027.

## 📅 Study Strategy
- **Daily Discipline:** Solve and record at least one problem every day.
- **Language:** Java (Core focus on efficiency and clean code).
- **Goal:** Build a solid foundation for the Georgia Tech BS/MS program and upcoming recruiting seasons.

## 🛠 Progress Tracker

### 1. Fundamentals & Linear Data Structures
- [x] **Arrays & Hashing:** Basic manipulation, HashMaps, and Sets.
- [x] **Strings:** Pattern matching and string manipulation.
- [x] **Sorting & Searching:** Binary search and various sorting algorithms.
- [x] **Linked List:** Singly/Doubly linked lists and cycle detection.

### 2. Specialized Structures
- [x] **Stack:** LIFO operations and monotonic stacks.
- [x] **Queue:** FIFO operations.
- [x] **Priority Queue (Heap):** Min/Max heaps and top-K problems.

### 3. Advanced Techniques
- [x] **Two Pointers:** In-place array/string manipulation.
- [x] **Sliding Window:** Subarray/Substring optimization.
- [x] **Trees:** DFS/BFS traversals, Binary Search Trees (BST).

### 4. Graphs (In Progress)
- [ ] **Foundations:** Adjacency List/Matrix and Graph representations.
- [ ] **Traversals:** BFS & DFS (Cycle detection, Connected Components).
- [ ] **Shortest Path:** Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and Topological Sort.

### 5. Upcoming Topics (In Progress)
- [ ] Dynamic Programming (DP)
- [ ] Recursion & Backtracking
